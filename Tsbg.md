Subject: Request to Reduce Working Hours under § 8 TzBfG

Dear Ms / Mr <Last‑Name>,

I hereby request, pursuant to section 8 of the German Part‑Time and Fixed‑Term Employment Act (Teilzeit‑ und Befristungsgesetz, TzBfG), that my regular weekly working time be reduced from 40 hours to 20 hours, effective 1 September 2025.

Proposed distribution of hours  
• Monday–Friday, 13:00 – 17:00 (4 hours per day)  
• Work location and duties unchanged

The change will enable me to attend daily German‑language classes while continuing to fulfil my responsibilities to the company.  
I am, of course, open to discussing alternative schedules (for example, 30 hours per week) if operational needs require.

Please confirm your decision in writing by 1 August 2025 in accordance with § 8 (5) TzBfG.  
I would be happy to meet at your convenience to discuss the details.

Thank you for considering my request.

Kind regards,

<Your‑Name>  
<Your‑Position>  
<Date>
