### How to Use This Template

1. Copy the file into the project repository.
2. Fill all *italicised mandatory* fields in the first pass.
3. Attach diagrams and CI/CD artefacts for each design review iteration.

This template unifies proven SDD conventions([cms.gov][1], [voa.va.gov][5], [ntrs.nasa.gov][2]) with current on-prem Kubernetes guidance([armosec.io][3], [groundcover.com][4], [kubernetes.io][6]) and disaster-recovery practices for etcd([kubernetes.io][8], [spectrocloud.com][9], [docs.oracle.com][10]), ensuring complete coverage from business goals to operations and DR.

Below is an English version of the 18-section design-documentation template we discussed.  It combines widely adopted frameworks—the C4 model, the Twelve-Factor App methodology, and Google Anthos reference architectures—into a practical outline that answers the day-to-day questions platform and application engineers meet when building, running, and operating a hybrid Anthos/Kubernetes cloud. ([c4model.com][1], [12factor.net][2], [cloud.google.com][3])

## 1. Purpose & Scope

Describe **what problem the system or subsystem solves, the measurable business value it delivers, and what is explicitly out of scope**. Clear boundaries keep reviews focused and prevent scope creep. ([cloud.google.com][3])

## 2. Context & Stakeholders

List **external users, internal feature teams, SRE/ops roles, security teams, and regulators**. Mapping stakeholders up front drives API design, UX decisions, and SLO commitments. ([cloud.google.com][4])

## 3. Architectural Overview (C4 Levels 1-2)

Provide **System-Context and Container diagrams** that show how the subsystem fits into the hybrid Anthos landscape (on-prem clusters plus GKE) and which shared services (Config Management, Service Mesh, etc.) it depends on. ([c4model.com][1], [medium.com][5])

## 4. Component & Microservice Detail (C4 Levels 3-4)

For every component list **responsibility, inputs/outputs, Kubernetes resource type (Deployment, StatefulSet, Job), owning team, and API versioning policy**. This detail speeds change-impact analysis. ([sheldonrcohen.medium.com][6])

## 5. Infrastructure & Deployment Topology

Diagram **on-prem Anthos clusters (VMware / bare-metal), regional GKE clusters, fleet membership, failure-domains, Cloud VPN/Interconnect paths, and DNS strategy**. ([cloud.google.com][3], [medium.com][5])

## 6. Interfaces & Integrations

Catalog **north-/south-bound APIs, ingress controllers, service meshes, external SaaS, and event buses**, noting protocol (gRPC, REST, Pub/Sub), versioning, and backward-compatibility rules. ([cloud.google.com][7], [cloud.google.com][8])

## 7. Data Management

Identify **systems of record (databases, object storage), replication-topology, backup plan, StorageClasses, RPO/RTO targets, and data lineage requirements**. ([en.wikipedia.org][9])

## 8. Security & Compliance

Cover **authentication/authorization (Workload Identity, RBAC), network policies, encryption at-rest/in-transit, secret management, and regulatory standards (ISO 27001, GDPR, etc.)**. ([cloud.google.com][10])

## 9. Reliability & Resilience

Declare **SLIs/SLOs, error-budget policy, quorum or consensus strategy, multi-cluster fail-over design, and the incident-command process used during outages**. ([sre.google][11], [mirantis.com][12])

## 10. Scalability & Performance

Detail **horizontal/vertical autoscaling rules, resource limits/requests, representative load profiles, and benchmark results** so teams can size environments correctly. ([mirantis.com][12], [getambassador.io][13])

## 11. Observability & Operations

Specify **exported metrics, structured logs, traces, alert rules, dashboards, runbooks, and on-call escalation paths**—the “single pane of glass” for SREs. ([sre.google][11])

## 12. Configuration & Runtime Environment

Apply **Twelve-Factor principles—config via environment variables, immutable container images, and strict separation of code and state**—to guarantee parity between on-prem and GKE. ([12factor.net][2], [en.wikipedia.org][9])

## 13. Dependencies & Third-Party Services

Record **base-image versions, operators/CRDs, external APIs, and the SLOs you rely on** so downstream risks are visible during reviews. ([cloud.google.com][8])

## 14. Release, Migration & Rollback Strategy

Describe **CI/CD pipeline stages, blue-green or canary deployment patterns, schema-migration workflows, and the phased retirement plan for legacy versions**. ([medium.com][14], [spacelift.io][15])

## 15. Constraints, Assumptions & Risk Mitigation

List **technical or organisational constraints, key assumptions, identified risks (e.g., single-region storage), and mitigation tactics**. ([cloud.google.com][3])

## 16. Cost & Capacity Planning

Show **GCP usage projections, on-prem licence and hardware costs, and the budget for SRE coverage** to keep finance teams in the loop. ([medium.com][5])

## 17. Architectural Decisions & Alternatives (ADRs)

Log **every significant design decision with date, author, context, and the alternatives rejected**, making later audits and reversals straightforward. ([sheldonrcohen.medium.com][6])

## 18. References, Glossary & Appendices

Provide **source documents, a glossary of Anthos terms (GKE Hub, Fleet, ASM, etc.), and any oversized diagrams or code samples** that would otherwise clutter the main text. ([c4model.com][1])

**Next step**: pick a section—say *Infrastructure & Deployment Topology*—and we can draft the concrete diagrams, YAML snippets, and review checklist together.
