# **Template Version**: 1.0.0 (12 June 2025)

Below is design-documentation template. This template unifies proven SDD conventions with current on-prem Kubernetes guidance and disaster-recovery practices for etcd, ensuring complete coverage from business goals to operations and DR.

## How to Use This Template

1. Copy the file into the project repository.
2. Fill all *italicised mandatory* fields in the first pass.
3. Attach diagrams and CI/CD artefacts for each design review iteration.

## Executive Summary

* **Business price**
* **Key risks**
* **C4-1 level diagram**

## System Overview

*Capture basic System identity and ownership.*

* **System Name**: `{{Enter}}`
* **Status**: Completed | In Progress | Not Required
* **Design Review Date**: `{{Enter}}`
* **Work Groups / Contributors**: `{{Name, team, contact}}`
* **Teams Channel**: `{{Link}}`

## 1. Purpose & Scope

Describe **what problem the system or subsystem solves, the measurable business value it delivers, and what is explicitly out of scope**. Clear boundaries keep reviews focused and prevent scope creep.

## 2. Context & Stakeholders

List **external users, internal teams, SRE/ops teams, security teams, and regulators**. Mapping stakeholders up front drives API design, UX decisions, and SLO commitments.

*HC Core, Business, SRE, SEC, Network, DC Ops, etc.*

| Name & Role | Team | Contact |
| ----------- | ---- | ------- |

## 3. Architectural Overview (C4 Levels 1-2)

Provide **System-Context and Container diagrams** that show how the subsystem fits into the hybrid Anthos landscape (on-prem clusters plus GKE) and which shared services (Config Management, Service Mesh, etc.) it depends on.

*Logical -> high-level physical; include diagrams.*

* Methodology (12-factor, Googole, AWS, Asure, etc.)
* Logical diagram (services, flows)
* Physical diagram (nodes, networks)
* Supporting artefacts: Helm-chart dependency graphs, CI/CD pipeline drafts
* Align with CNCF cluster architecture concepts

## 4. Component & Microservice Detail (C4 Levels 3-4)

For every component list **responsibility, inputs/outputs, Kubernetes resource type (Deployment, StatefulSet, Job, etc.), owning team, and API versioning policy**. This detail speeds change-impact analysis.

## 5. Infrastructure & Deployment Topology

Diagram **on-prem Anthos clusters (bare-metal), regional GKE clusters, fleet membership, failure-domains, Cloud Network and DNS strategy**.

## 6. Dependencies, Interfaces, Integrations & Third-Party Services

Record **base-image versions, operators/CRDs, external APIs, and the SLOs you rely on** so downstream risks are visible during reviews.

Catalog **north-/south-bound APIs, ingress controllers, service meshes, external SaaS, and event buses**, noting protocol (gRPC, REST), versioning, and backward-compatibility rules.

## 7. Data Management

Identify **systems of record (databases, object storage), replication-topology, backup plan, StorageClasses, RPO/RTO targets, and data lineage requirements**.

## 8. Summary table of non-functional Requirements (NFR)

| Category           | Metric         | Goal         |
| ------------------ | -------------- | ------------ |
| Performance        | p95 latency    | ≤ 150 ms     |
| Security           | GDPR-compliant | Да           |
| Availability       | SLO 99.9 %     | 43 min/month |

The matrix simplifies the verification of compliance with ISO 27001 and other standards

## 9. Security & Compliance

Cover **authentication/authorization (Workload Identity, RBAC), network policies, encryption at-rest/in-transit, secret management, and regulatory standards (ISO 27001, GDPR, etc.)**.

## 10. Scalability, Reliability, Performance & Resilience

Declare **SLIs/SLOs, error-budget policy, quorum or consensus strategy, multi-cluster fail-over design, and the incident-command process used during outages**.

*Target SLA/SLO, capacity headroom.*

**Disaster Recovery** *RPO/RTO, quarterly DR drills, etcd snapshot frequency.*

Detail **horizontal/vertical autoscaling rules, resource limits/requests, representative load profiles, and benchmark results** so teams can size environments correctly.

## 11. Observability & Operations

Specify **exported metrics, structured logs, traces, alert rules, dashboards, runbooks, and on-call escalation paths**—the "single pane of glass" for SREs.

Clearly separate Metrics, Logs, Traces (MELT)

Define the SLO -> Alert -> Runbook chain -> Escalation path/paths

Add obligatory Grafana/Prometheus dashboards (links to JSON)

This makes SRE's life easier and specifies the error budget policy.

## 12. Configuration & Runtime Environment

Apply **Twelve-Factor principles—config via environment variables, immutable container images, and strict separation of code and state**.

## 13. Release, Deployment, Migration & Rollback Strategy

Describe **CI/CD pipeline stages, blue-green or canary deployment patterns, schema-migration workflows, and the phased retirement plan for legacy versions**.

*Cluster API, Ansible, Metal LB; GitOps pipeline stages.*

**Operations** *Patch management, inventory, audit, report distribution.*

## 14. Constraints, Assumptions & Risk Mitigation

List **technical or organisational constraints, key assumptions, identified risks (e.g., single-region storage), and mitigation tactics**.

## 15. Cost & Capacity Planning

Show **GCP usage projections, on-prem licence and Hardware & Operating System costs, and the budget for SRE coverage** to keep finance teams in the loop.

*Server models, CPU/RAM, OS (e.g., RHEL 9).*

## 16. Architectural Decisions & Alternatives (ADRs)

**Implement** the ADR log using the Michael Nygard template: [github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record)

Keep ADR files next to the code (/docs/adr/<ID>-title.md)

Refer to the relevant ADR

Log **every significant design decision with date, author, context, and the alternatives rejected**, making later audits and reversals straightforward.

## 17. User Interfaces

*CLI (kubectl), Web UI (ArgoCD, Backstage portal, Kubernetes Dashboard).*

## 18. Fault Management

Failure modes, alerting, auto-healing, runbooks; include etcd snapshot/restore procedures per Kubernetes DR docs

## 19. Testing

Unit, integration, performance

## 20. Describe Disaster Recovery

Add a clear recovery process. For example etcdutl, snapshot, restore for all nodes from a single file, changing member ID before re-joining

Describe the frequency and check of DR drills (at least once a quarter)

## 20. References, Glossary & Appendices

Provide **source documents, a glossary of Anthos terms (GKE Hub, Fleet, ASM, etc.), and any oversized diagrams or code samples** that would otherwise clutter the main text.
